I co-founded Massive in 2016 along with Gabe Stein and Nadja Oertelt.
Massive is a science media company with the mission of helping readers discover and interact with science happening all around them.
We want to catalyze the breakdown of institutionalized scientific activity and research into smaller, community-based organizations.
Our coverage abandons the typical reporting on press releases and journal publications in order to replace it with a focus on the research and activity of DIY spaces and scientific startups.
