I was reminded from the _New York Times'_ article "[Tips and Myths About Extending Smartphone Battery Life][nyt]" about the way that some people will swipe up to close every "open" application on their phones.
I put open in quotes because, well, they aren't open.
As the article explains, "While that may be true on a computer, smartphones are designed differently: Once an app is no longer in the foreground — meaning you are not actively using it — most or all of its processes are frozen."
Closing them might actually be worse for battery life, since the app needs to completely reboot after being opened again.

The article doesn't say how the myth started, though.
I wonder about things like this.
