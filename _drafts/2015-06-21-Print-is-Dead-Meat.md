I'll say this up front: print is great.
Books, magazines, pamphlets, maps, newspapers: all of them just _feel good to hold_.
There's a beauty to the printed word that can't be captured on a screen.
At the same time, I'm finding it harder to accept printing as a responsible practice.
Buying a paper publication carries a greater guilt than I'm becoming comfortable with.
I feel about dead trees the same way I feel about dead meat.

I am not a vegetarian.
I am not a vegetarian because fried chicken, hamburgers, and bacon are delicious.
Still, I know that these come to me at a terrible costâ€”much higher than the price-per-pound I pay at the grocery store.

[The entire industry is unsustainable and environmentally toxic.][Feedlots]
_I know all of this and I still buy into it._
Every time I do, I feel guilty.
Still, I bury my guilt and buy it and cook it and eat it.
After all, dead meat tastes so good.

Like I said: print is great.
