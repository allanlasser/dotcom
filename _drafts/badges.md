If we want to regain control of our attention, then let's start by eliminating badges.
In web design vocabulary, a _badge_ describes a brightly colored circle appended to another element.
It indicates, generally, that there's something unread.
Unfortunately, badges are abused.
There are very few cases where an unread count is useful and many cases where it can be dangerous.
It's even fair to call them an [anti-pattern][wiki-ap].
Badges pique our curiosity, providing anyone an opening to sneak in and capture our attention.

Badges may compel us to act in unordinary ways.
Following its launch, Karissa Bell reported on [criticism of Twitter's new Moments feature][moments].
The feature marks itself with a blue dot whenever a new "Moment" is happening on the network.
According to Bell, this [pale blue dot][sagan] "may seem innocent enough, but Twitter users — trained to tap the dot to check their mentions or home timelines — are seriously enraged by [it]."
Bell then quotes complaints about the anxious compulsion to "clear" the dot.
When the interface breeds anxieties and compulsions, it's a failure.

Badges should be disabled by default, but they never are.
A primary reason for this is the unchallenged assumption that they should even exist, at all.
Looking back on his decisions when designing [NetNewsWire][wiki-nnw], Brent Simmons [recalls][inessential] (emphasis his):

> Adding an unread count [to a RSS reader] seemed like a natural thing to do — Mail had one, after all.
> It didn’t even occur to me that it might not be _safe_.
> […]
> There was a tyranny behind keeping track of unread items and showing an unread count. People reacted in different ways, but many people felt like they always had to go through everything.

The "tyranny behind" badges is the latent influence of our interfaces.
The interface compels us to respond, regardless of whether we want to.
The bright red badge and its accompanying unread count is a siren call.
The feeling of "always [having] to go through everything" is a dangerous one.
We're afraid of missing something potentially important, so we follow it.
Even if, in the end, it makes us captives of a system we cannot control.

Lighthouses shine not to attract ships towards them, but to warn sailors away.
In other words, the signal should benefit its audience, not its publisher.
Badges raise powerful signals.
Sometimes they're necessary and helpful.
But if we continue to display them without challenging their abuse, then the signals are not working in our favor.
Disabling all the badges, everywhere, restores our control.
They should only be invited back when, without their presence, you cannot see the shore.
