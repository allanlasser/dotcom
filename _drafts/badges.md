After it launched, Karissa Bell [reported on criticism of Twitter's new Moments feature](http://mashable.com/2015/10/12/twitter-moments-blue-dot/).
The feature displays a permanent blue dot on its tab, which "may seem innocent enough, but Twitter users — trained to tap the dot to check their mentions or home timelines — are seriously enraged by [it]."
Bell then quotes a number of toots, all complaining about their anxious compulsion to "clear" the dot.
In this case, Twitter's UI is acting with hostility towards its users.

Badges should be disabled by default, but they’re not.
There are very few cases where an unread count is useful and many cases where it can be dangerous.
It's even fair to call these unread signals an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern).
Looking back on his decisions when designing [NetNewsWire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetNewsWire), Brent Simmons [recalls](http://inessential.com/2014/03/31/mark_all_as_read):

> Adding an unread count [to a RSS reader] seemed like a natural thing to do — Mail had one, after all.
> It didn’t even occur to me that it might not be _safe_.
> […]
> There was a tyranny behind keeping track of unread items and showing an unread count. People reacted in different ways, but many people felt like they always had to go through everything.

The feeling of "always [having] to go through everything" is a toxic one.
In Simmons's experience, people reacted in different ways, but with the same outcome.
The bright red badge and its accompanying unread count is a siren call.
We're afraid of missing something potentially important, so we follow it.
It distracts us from the moment we pull out our phones to accomplish something.
We lose ourselves in it and ask, five or ten minutes later, "what was I doing?"

It's important to be aware of the signals being projected.
The "tyranny behind" badges is the latent influence of our interfaces.
The interface compels us to respond, regardless of whether we want to.
When we allow these interfaces to behave <unquestioningly>, then we avoid confronting their abuse.
Turning off badges is a challenge to the pattern and it behaviors it breeds in us.
Shoo them all away.
Only when their absence becomes <noticable> should they be invited back.
