_The Boston Globe_ is one of the few newspapers that still does its printing in-house.
I know this because the [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/) office is inside the Globe Building.
It's fun to watch the print machines running.
Ribbons of paper just roll through them.
The assembly line is fully automated.
There's even robots in the basementâ€”they lug around multi-ton rolls of news paper and feed the printing machines.
Since _The Globe_ is the regional New England paper, it's trucked from Boston to all over the Northeast.
Some trucks need to leave at 3:00 AM in order to get the paper its Maine subscribers on-time.
This happens each day, every day.
Why are we still spreading the news this way?
Why are we reading anything on paper anymore?

Books, magazines, pamphlets, maps, newspapers: all of them just feel good to hold.
Paper is comfortable, ordinary and tangible.
There's a beauty to the printed word that can't be captured on a screen.
Yet for each notebook and novel and magazine I buy and read and use and recycle, the guilt feels a little stronger each time.
I'm finding it harder to justify printing as a responsible practice.
So much water and ink and energy goes into just making print.
It has to be moved from wherever it's made to everywhere it's sold.
Then once somebody's done with it, it ends up in the trash.
I don't think the ends can justify the means.
Despite this, I don't stop buying or reading print, either.
In many ways, I feel about reading dead trees the same way I feel about eating dead meat.

I'm not vegetarian.
I'm not vegetarian because fried chicken, hamburgers, and bacon are crazy delicious.
Still, I know that these come to me at a terrible cost.
It's a cost much higher than the price-per-pound I pay at the grocery store.
[Conditions on factory farms are terrible.][Ag Gag]
[Animals are kept and slaughtered in terrifying and dehumanizing conditions.][Every Twelve Seconds]
[The entire industry is unsustainable and environmentally toxic.][Feedlots]
I know all of this and I still buy into it.
Every time I do, I feel guilty.
Still, I bury my guilt and buy it and cook it and eat it.
After all, dead meat tastes so good.
Yet the more I justify it like that, the worse that justification sounds.

I justify buying and reading print in the same way that I justify buying and eating meat.
Both leave me satisfied.
But is my satisfaction worth their cost?
Everything around me shouts, "Yes, all the time!"
I tell myself, "Yes, but in considerate moderation."
The answer is, "No, it isn't."

I'm trying very hard to accept that.
