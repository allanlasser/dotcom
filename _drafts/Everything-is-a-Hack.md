title: Everything is a Hack

Something I've learned from working on software every day is that everything is a broken pile of hacked-together solutions.
Now, everywhere I look all I see is hacks.
That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.
Hacks can be clever.
But they don't have to be: some of the best hacks are just plain obvious, e.g. those little wooden wedges are a pretty obvious hack for keeping a door stopped.
There's a certain relief in that, since it means nothing you ever make needs to be perfect.
It's just the newest addition to the pile of hacks.
The more I think this way, the more I see everything this way:

<blockquote class="dialog">
    <p class="call">Does it work?</p>
    <p class="response">Yes, but barely.</p>
    <p class="call">Great, on to the next thing!</p>
</blockquote>

Newspapers are a hack like everything else is a hack:

<blockquote class="dialog">
    <p class="call">How do we spread information to the most people in the least time?</p>
    <p class="response">Try putting the same words on lots of sheets of paper and then give them to people.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that but it's really expensive.</p>
    <p class="response">Try getting other people to pay you to put their words on your paper.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that and it worked great for a while but now people are just putting their words on the Internet.</p>
    <p class="response">Try getting people to pay more for our words.</p>
    <p class="call">We tried, they won't.</p>
    <p class="response">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
</blockquote>

The factory farm system is a hack like everything else is a hack:

<blockquote class="dialog">
    <p class="call">How can we make the most meat possible in the shortest amount of time possible?</p>
    <p class="response">Try packing the most animals you can into a lot or a barn and feed them a diet of starch and hormones.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that and the chickens keep pecking each other and the hogs keep fighting each other.</p>
    <p class="response">Try clipping the beaks off the chickens and separate the hogs into crates.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that and now animal rights activists are sneaking into our farms/factories and recording us doing this and it looks really bad and people might not want to buy our meat anymore.</p>
    <p class="response">Try passing laws that make it illegal for them to do that.</p>
