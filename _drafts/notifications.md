Computers are moving into the background.
They're becoming less obvious.
However, the ways we interface with computers isn't advancing at the same pace.
That is to say, the interfaces we're using are from a time when we turned computers off.
Now they're on all the time, in our pockets, on our wrists, inside our toasters.
But it isn't all our toaster's fault.
Our ability to cope with the computer's increasing omnipresence isn't adapting as fast as computers are.
It's a race against time, and we're at a handicap.

Notifications are an example of this.
They are a new way for computers to talk to us.
Unfortunately, they're limited by old vocabularies.
From this limitation, notifications collect inside inboxes and are given unread counts.
Notifications do not belong in an inbox.
Notifications should not have an unread count.
They're too unimportant on their own and too <numerous> to be shown all at once.

On the other hand, they're not going away.
Notifications are convenient.
They are also annoying.
Like a bad first date, our dumb software doesn’t recognize when it is considerate or obnoxious.
This is forgivable.
After all, this is a new interface.
It hasn't yet found its right shape.
In the meantime, there's a few simple tweaks that lends these things a lighter weight and a smaller footprint.

# No Badges

Badges should be disabled by default, but they’re not.
There are very few cases where an unread count is useful and many cases where it can be dangerous.
Looking back on his decisions when designing [NetNewsWire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetNewsWire), Brent Simmons [recalls](http://inessential.com/2014/03/31/mark_all_as_read):

> Adding an unread count [to a RSS reader] seemed like a natural thing to do — Mail had one, after all.
> It didn’t even occur to me that it might not be _safe_.
> […]
> There was a tyranny behind keeping track of unread items and showing an unread count. People reacted in different ways, but many people felt like they always had to go through everything.

The feeling of "always [having] to go through everything" is a toxic one.
In Simmons's experience, people reacted in different ways, but with the same outcome.
The bright red badge and its accompanying unread count is a siren call.
We're afraid of missing something potentially important, so we follow it.
It distracts us from the moment we pull out our phones to accomplish something.
We lose ourselves in it and ask, five or ten minutes later, "what was I doing?"

It's important to be aware of the signals being projected.
The "tyranny behind" badges is the latent influence of our interfaces.
The interface compels us to respond, regardless of whether we want to.
When we allow these interfaces to behave <unquestioningly>, then we avoid confronting their abuse.
Turning off badges is a challenge to the pattern and it behaviors it breeds in us.
Shoo them all away.
Only when their absence becomes <noticable> should they be invited back.

# No Leaky Faucets

Another problem with notifications is they let us know when they arrive.
It's distracting and obnoxious.
This problem is exacerbated at night, when we're trying to relax ourselves into sleep.

#

Badges are opaque, and this is a problem.
Badges tell us there's something we don't know.
We don't know if what we don't know is important until we check it.
That means opening the program and becoming distracted, all in the service of removing the badge.

Noises are distracting, and this is a problem.
Notifications announce their presence.
We don't know if they're important until we check them.
That means making us anxious and alert.

A simpler way is to just let the notifications collect.
Let them pile up!
