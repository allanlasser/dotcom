If we want to regain control of our attention, then let's start by eliminating badges.

In web design vocabulary, a _badge_ describes a brightly colored circle appended to another element.
It indicates, generally, that there's something unread.
Unfortunately, badges are abused.
There are very few cases where an unread count is useful and many cases where it can be dangerous.
It's even fair to call them an [anti-pattern][wiki-ap].
When a badge piques our curiosity, it provides an opening to steal our focus.

Badges compel us to act in unusual ways.
For a recent example, take the [negative reaction to Twitter's new Moments feature][moments].
The feature marks itself with a blue dot whenever a new "Moment" is happening on Twitter's network.
Karissa Bell reports this [pale blue dot][sagan] "may seem innocent enough, but Twitter users — trained to tap the dot to check their mentions or home timelines — are seriously enraged by [it]."
Bell then quotes complaints about the anxious compulsion to "clear" the dot.
The purpose of the badge is clearly to attract attention.
If people can't stop tapping into it to clear the dot, then is the feature a success?
The interface fails when it breeds anxieties and compulsions because it disempowers its users.
Unfortunately, the appearance of the badge is under Twitter's control and there's no way to disable it.

Badges should be disabled by default, but they never are.
The assumptions underlying their presence go unchallenged.
Looking back on his decisions when designing [NetNewsWire][wiki-nnw], Brent Simmons [recalls][inessential] (emphasis his):

> Adding an unread count [to a RSS reader] seemed like a natural thing to do — Mail had one, after all.
> It didn’t even occur to me that it might not be _safe_.
> […]
> There was a tyranny behind keeping track of unread items and showing an unread count. People reacted in different ways, but many people felt like they always had to go through everything.

The "tyranny behind" badges is the latent influence of our interfaces.
The interface compels us to respond, regardless of whether we want to.
The bright red badge and its accompanying unread count is a siren call.
The feeling of "always [having] to go through everything" is a dangerous one.
We're afraid of missing something potentially important, so we follow it.
Even if, in the end, it makes us captives of a system we cannot control.

Lighthouses shine not to attract ships towards them, but to warn sailors away.
In other words, the signal should inform its recipient, not benefit the one who raises it.
Badges are strong signals.
They can be helpful.
But if we continue to display them without challenging their abuse, then the signals are not working in our favor.
Disabling all the badges, everywhere, restores our control.
They should only be invited back when, without their presence, you cannot see the shore.
