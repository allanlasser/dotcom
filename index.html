            <p>I am a co-founder of <a href="/projects/massive">Massive</a>, a science media company, where we are giving everyone the scientific tools to grapple with uncertainty. We are exploring beyond the accepted norms of online publishing, away from virality and pageviews, and looking for a more iterative and agile way to tell meaningful, memorable, and informative stories about the science being done today.</p>
            <p>Between 2014 and 2016, I was the designer and developer at <a  href="/projects/muckrock">MuckRock</a>, where I helped ordinary people make sense of public records. In addition to a top-to-bottom redesign of the platform, I designed and developed many new interfaces, experiences, and features which helped the platform to grow its revenue, userbase, and reputation. I also started <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/project/hunting-for-governments-oldest-computer-32/">a hunt for the oldest computer in government</a>, which led me to write about <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/may/26/when-conducting-census-computers-count/">the history of computation in the U.S. Census Bureau</a> and <a href="/essays/voyager">the computers aboard the Voyager probes</a>.</p>
            <p>In 2014, I graduated from <a href="http://bu.edu/">Boston University</a> with a degree in Computer Science and another degree in American Studies. In 2012, I wrote <a  href="/essays/charlesgate">my American Studies thesis</a> on the urban growth of a small area of Boston, which I was invited to present at the 2013 Eastern American Studies Association Conference. It was subsequently published in <a href="https://journals.psu.edu/ne/issue/view/2861">the introductory issue of New Errands</a>, a journal of undergraduate research.</p>
            <p>While at <abbr title="Boston University">B.U.</abbr> I joined and later became publisher of <a class="i" href="http://buquad.com">The Quad</a>, an independent student magazine. It was at <i>The Quad</i> where I cut my teeth on Wordpress, making some of my first web designs while learning about <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">responsive design</a>, <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography">browser typography</a>, and <a href="http://shapeofdesignbook.com/">how design happens</a>. I also wrote historical essays about the shape of the <abbr title="Boston University">B.U.</abbr> campus, like <a href="/essays/campus">the planned campus that never was</a> and <a href="/essays/home-of-the-braves">the baseball stadium that was demolished to make way for dormitories</a>.</p>
