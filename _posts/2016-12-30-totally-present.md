Something I find fascinating about science is the way that it's got one eye on the future and another eye on the past.
One part of a scientist's job is to predict the future: to make a hypothesis about the way something will happen.
But in order to know what kind of hypothesis to make, they need to look into the past to see what kinds of guesses and experiments and lessons preceded them.

Furthermore, we look back to and hold up the theoretical scientists who made really startling or amazing predictions.
They didn't even test their own predictions most of the time!
Like, Einstein was just a theorist, and we're still experimentally proving his theories to this day.
The confirmation of gravitational waves, which was probably the biggest discovery this year, was just proving Einstein's prediction correct.
And this prediction was over a century old!

I think this is different and more empowering than other kinds of prediction, like say the stock market or weather forecasting, because it's an active process of realizing the future.
Rather than seeing if a storm actually blows through this afternoon or whether or not a share price rises, scientists are actively creating a future in response to the past.
That this process repeats and builds upon itself using the same patterns of hypothesis and experimentation connects us so deeply to the people who we're following after and to the people who may one day follow us.
