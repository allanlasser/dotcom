[_Shopper_][shopper] is a deeply moving and narrowly focused documentary short film.
It follows a bus driver in Flint, MI as he drives his route from poor neighborhoods to local supermarkets.
It documents poverty, food deserts, public transportation, and community service with such an economy of storytelling that it brings the reality of the situation into stark relief.
When these separate forces are presented together as a hurricane of economic depression, it seems so ordinary, inescapable, and accepted.
Yet the piece captures the unwavering optimism of its subject, Joe Harris.
In the end, it results in a complex and layered piece of storytelling that seems to capture a dialog between a community and its inhabitants instead of exacting a judgement against them.
