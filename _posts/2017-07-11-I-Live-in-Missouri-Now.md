It's true! Since June I've been a resident of the beautiful city of Columbia in the  Show Me state.   After living within the [Northeast Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_megalopolis) my entire life, growing up in New Jersey then moving to Boston for school and sticking around after that. I've learned so much between preparing for the move, making the move, and trying to settle in. Here's some notes.

## Some people are really fucking condescending about living in the Midwest.

One extremely common reaction I got when telling people, "I'm moving to Missouri soon" was (and say this in your head in the most dismissive tone possible) "*Why?*" or "What could *possibly* be in Missouri?". The more it happened:

1. the more predictable it became, to the point where a reaction of genuine positive interest became rare and almost exclusively exhibited by people I'd met who'd actually *lived* in Columbia before.
2. the more the outline of the supposed elite East Coast bubble I'd been living in became much more clearly defined and made me that much more ready to take a break from it for a while.

## Moving more than a day's drive away is an experience I'd recommend everybody go through at least once.

It's much easier if you're in the situation that I was in Boston when everything you own can fit comfortably into just your bedroom, but the opportunity to actually be ruthless about getting rid of everything that wasn't *necessary* to starting over was incredibly valuable. I might have taken a few too many books or objects of sentimental value with me, but I'm more aware of their personal value to me now. Part of participating in a material culture means attaching my identity to the things I own, and throwing things overboard gave me a chance to both refine that identity and attach more meaning to the things I held onto.

Also, the process was not only cheaper and easier than I would've expected a major uprooting to be. Now I have an understanding of how much it might cost in the future, which is about $2000. That makes planning subsequent moves easier and also gives me a more realistic sense of how much time I need to spend in a place to make moving long-distance worth it and how much preparation/saving I need to do before it's possible again.

## Making new friends from scratch is very difficult and not something I'm particularly good at yet.

I kinda threw myself into the deep end on this one and I'll admit that I've been struggling with this. I've always been pretty introverted and relied on pre-existing social setups —school, work, etc.—to meet new people. Dropping someplace without those structures to lean on has been really difficult. It's also a hard problem to get unstuck from, since there's very few people who can help you out of it. It's something I'm working at—as much as I can—and I'll definitely be journaling more about it in the future.

## America is big and being here feels less like a different song and more like the cover of a song I already know real well.

I'm not sure if that metaphor makes any sense, BUT what I'm trying to say it that living in a new part of the country feels way, way less than being abroad than it does having all the variables slightly tweaked on similar surroundings. The architecture is different and beer is cheaper and people talk and behave different, but it's all according to the same norms that I'm used to. Except that there's a bar at the grocery store. That's pretty foreign to me.
