Something I've learned from working on software every day is that everything is a broken pile of hacked-together solutions.
Hacks aren't _necessarily_ a bad thing, though.
They can be clever.
Although they don't have to be.
Some of the best hacks are just plain obvious, e.g. those little wooden wedges are a pretty obvious hack for keeping a door stopped.
There's a certain relief in everything being a hack.
I means nothing you ever make needs to be perfect, just good enough.

The more I think this way, the more I see everything this way:

<blockquote class="dialog">
    <p class="call">Does it work?</p>
    <p class="response">Yes, but barely.</p>
    <p class="call">Great, on to the next thing!</p>
</blockquote>

Newspapers are a hack like everything else is a hack:

<blockquote class="dialog">
    <p class="call">How do we spread information to the most people in the least time?</p>
    <p class="response">Try putting the same words on lots of sheets of paper and then give them to people.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that but it's really expensive.</p>
    <p class="response">Try getting other people to pay you to put their words on your paper.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that and it worked great for a while but now people are just putting their words on the Internet.</p>
    <p class="response">Try getting people to pay more for our words.</p>
    <p class="call">We tried, they won't.</p>
    <p class="response">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
</blockquote>

The factory farm system is a hack like everything else is a hack:

<blockquote class="dialog">
    <p class="call">How can we make the most meat possible in the shortest amount of time possible?</p>
    <p class="response">Try packing the most animals you can into a lot or a barn and feed them a diet of starch and hormones.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that and the chickens keep pecking each other and the hogs keep fighting each other.</p>
    <p class="response">Try clipping the beaks off the chickens and separate the hogs into crates.</p>
    <p class="call">Okay we tried that and now animal rights activists are sneaking into our farms/factories and recording us doing this and it looks really bad and people might not want to buy our meat anymore.</p>
    <p class="response">Try passing laws that make it illegal for them to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

It's not really any one person's fault that anything is as bad as it is.
Everything is a hack.
But!
Once enough hacks pile up, they begin to create more problems when they solve.
The hacks start requiring hacks.
That's when the whole system goes to hell.

Something else I've learned from working on software everyday is that everything can be refactored.
Hacks are passable, but not optimal.
As soon as possible, hacks should be cleaned up and replaced with more elegant solutions.

Unfortunately, refactors aren't valued to the degree they should be.
Refactors are often invisible—as long as a refactor succeeds, nothing is different on the surface.
When it comes to aging infrastructure, correcting corrupted institutions, or rewriting crufty code, the hacks are often hidden from us.

If progress is a fragile pile of hacks, then it's so much easier to lose when the hacks cannot suffice.
The solution is to say, every once in a while, "Back to the first thing!"
Instead of "On to the next thing!"
