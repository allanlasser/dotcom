I'm in the middle of reading James Gleick's *The Information* (which is fantastic, by the way!), and I was really struck by this observation of his:

> Like the printing press, the telegraph, and the telephone before it, the Internet is transforming the language simply by transmitting information differently. What makes cyberspace different from all previous information technologies is its intermixing of scales from the largest to the smallest without prejudice, broadcasting to the millions, narrowcasting to groups, instant messaging one to one.[^1]

In this context, Gleick is talking about the explosion of words making up the English language, and how that explosion was catalyzed by the degree of connections facilitated by each medium.

And then, just now, I came across this tweet by [@pinboard](https://twitter.com/pinboard):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">there is no way to hold campaigns or candidates accountable when you can say a thousand different things to micro-targeted voters</p>&mdash; Pinboard (@Pinboard) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/890568929248260096">July 27, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Which totally clicked with that last thought. Extrapolating from Gleick, language is just _one_ example of the ways the Internet is transforming our entire society and culture "simply by transmitting information differently." The ability for politicians to ditch broad policies and platforms in place of microtargeting—inspired by the way the Internet has already changed the business of marketing to and targeting consumers—has been and will be a difficult aspect of a political campaign to reason about and be held accountable for.

In a way, this also describes spamming really well. The art of spamming exploits the tension between these intermixing scales, where everybody can be individually addressed. Spamming relies on just a few 

Which connects to this _other_ thing I saw last week:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This Amazon bot is generating thousands of phone cases from random photos, and it&#39;s amazing. (via <a href="https://twitter.com/rjurney">@rjurney</a>) <a href="https://t.co/n63W4eo9Q5">https://t.co/n63W4eo9Q5</a> <a href="https://t.co/VX2Ch7xn9v">pic.twitter.com/VX2Ch7xn9v</a></p>&mdash; Andy Baio (@waxpancake) <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/884093248838418433">July 9, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is a more tangible instance of a spam bot, where the fact that as long as just a fraction of a percent of these phone cases can be sold to somebody, the cost of building and running the bot is totally justified.

[^1]: I think that the equal transformation of the word "phone" itself, from a person-to-person communication device to a general internet communication device, also reflects the way that scales of communication have multiplied and intermixed now.
