I am on a videogame music kick.
I've been listening to [Disasterpeace's][dp] in particular.
He made the music for [Fez][dp fez], along with other actual games.
But his best albums are for games that don't exist.
In particular, I've been loving [_Atebite and the Warring Nations_][dp atebite].
It belongs to a larger canon of sans-game soundtracks, like [_Neutralite_][dp neutralite] and [_The Chronicles of Jammage the Jam Mage_][dp jammage].

All of his music is available for streaming/download on [Bandcamp][dp bandcamp].
