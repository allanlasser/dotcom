I spent some time this holiday weekend catching up on my Instapaper queue.
A bunch of those articles were all freaked out by Uber.
They are right to be: Uber is freaky as heck.

From [Ben Thompson’s][twitter thompson] [“Why Uber Fights”][uber thompson]:

> The implications of this analysis cannot be underestimated: there is an absolutely massive worldwide market many times the size of the taxi market that has winner-take-all characteristics. Moreover, that winner is very unlikely to be challenged by a new entrant which will have far worse liquidity and an inferior cash position: Uber (presuming they are the winner) will simply lower prices and bleed the new entrant dry until they go out of business.

From [Bobbie Johnson’s][twitter johnson] [“How to Get Away with Uber”][uber johnson]:

> Amazon — more than any other company, more than Google, more than Facebook, more than Apple — taps into what people desire in a terrifyingly primal way: We want a thing, fast and preferably cheap. Not much else matters. We know Amazon’s not a nice company, and that the people who work there are treated poorly. We don’t always like it, but there is absolutely, definitively, nothing we will do to stop it.

From [Paul Ford’s][twitter ford] [“One Day, I Will Die on Mars”][uber ford]:

> _I am Uber. I believed to 0.56 certainty that I could find a bicycle for the person doing the delivery and provide that person with a discounted rental fee. Unfortunately the city of New York insists that bicycle rental kiosks must be controlled by an entity that is not Uber and thus I am not granted the level of full control that is necessary for me to truly optimize the city. No one benefits, no one at all._

So, Uber is terrifying because it will grow into something massive, the logic of the service demands it have a logistics monopoly, and because we’re going to tolerate socially destructive behavior because we’ll all have a tiny stake in its success. The ends will justify the means, and the meanness. That’s all pretty freaky.

Here’s what freaks me out about Uber, though: it goes to pretty far lengths to isolate you from your driver. You give the software your destination; the app gives the driver your destination. You pay the software; the software pays the driver (minus a cut off the top). We use the software to insulate ourselves against the people we pay to do things for us. The freakiest thing Uber can do is to actively isolate its customers from its workforce, so that we can be continually encouraged to use a service that makes millions of dollars by dumping all its risk onto its employees.

P.S. Johnson forgets to make an obvious analogy to Mechanical Turk. Just sayin'.
