Rdio was the best music streaming service, hands down.
It [went out of business](http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/17/9750890/rdio-shutdown-pandora) a little more than a year ago.

Rdio absolutely matched how I listen to and think about music.
Its interface was optimized for listening to full albums.
Building playlists was seamless and it was easy to subscribe to other people's playlists.
A few users took advantage of this in a unique way: they would put together a fresh collection of songs in the same playlist every week.
It was basically Discover Weekly before Discover Weekly, while having the charm and personality of the person who put it together.
Rdio nailed the social aspect, where it automatically told me about what other people were listening to, exposing me to so much music I never would have discovered myself. 
It was the rare piece of software that perfectly matched my needs, while empowering me to do more than I could before.

It was also just a beautifully designed piece of software.
Near the end of its life, after multiple revisions, its usability and aesthetics were just so simple and straightforward, with such an intense focus with letting the album art define the experience.
It made a museum for a media that's been commoditized.
It really felt like the people behind it just really loved music and understood the meaning and weight that a song or album can hold in a person's life.[^1]
In addition to its wonderful feature-set, Rdio really influenced the way I looked at interfaces and approached their design.

Spotify has come a long way since Rdio closed, not least by mimicking a variety of Rdio's interfaces and features.
While Spotify's automatic playlists, like Discover Weekly, absolutely deserve the praise they receive, it's cold.
There is a warmth to the idea that I might know a stranger a little better by getting to enjoy the same music as them.
That instead of a ubiquitous piece of software I'm in conversation with the people around me about what's fresh and what's timeless and what's interesting and what's remarkable.
Spotify built a dialog between myself and their software, which works and is worthwhile and meaningful in it's own way.
But Rdio build software for a conversation between myself and others, which is ultimately more powerful and memorable.
Which is why I miss Rdio every day.

It's great when you find out all these once-seemingly disparate things are actually really tightly connected.
