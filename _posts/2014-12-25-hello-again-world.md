Well, here I am again.
I feel like I do this every year.
But this year I'm serious!
(Even though I said that last year...)

What I like about blogging is how informal it is.
Just a dumping ground for ideas and pictures and whatever.
But I always mess it up!
I always take it too seriously, too personally.
Maybe my New Year's resolution should be to overcome perfectionism.
Actually, that's a great idea.

I think the rule for now will be ["bigger than a tweet."][six colors]
