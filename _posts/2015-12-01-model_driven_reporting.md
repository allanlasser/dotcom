I was really struck by a section of [Bret Victor's](http://worrydream.com) [dense essay on climate change](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) about what he calls [model-driven reporting](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#media):

> Modeling leads naturally from the particular to the general. Instead of seeing an individual proposal as “right or wrong”, “bad or good”, people can see it as one point in a large space of possibilities. By exploring the model, they come to understand the landscape of that space, and are in a position to invent better ideas for all the proposals to come. Model-driven material can serve as a kind of enhanced imagination.

I found the implementation of his idea really simple and striking.
Nothing fancy or serious, just playing with the numbers.
Tweak some rules and see the effects.
Dig into the effects to see how they’re calculated, and play with the calculations.
Find an answer yourself using the knowledge provided, or challenge the knowledge.
I also really like how this illuminates a series of interlocking systems.
Seeing the numbers all move around at once has a kind of parallax effect, with some sensitive values and other resistant values.
This means the actual work being done isn’t in explaining the outcomes and their merits, but in understanding and clearly communicating the underlying system.
Exposing the system, challenging the system, imagining a better implementation of the system.
And the reporting doesn’t have to be flashy!
With just a few numbers and sliders I have a better understanding of the problems and the solutions than all the think pieces or slideshows or video content you’d wanna throw at the problem.
For me this piece was a healthy reminder and a strong motivation to keep challenging the assumptions under my work, to try to ask better questions about the problems I’m solving.
