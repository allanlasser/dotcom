* Only address current concerns: sometimes I get really caught up building these super complex systems that I assume will help me work faster, later. But either I end up not using them or I get tired/forgetful of the systems I put in place. So I'm intentionally avoiding all of that. I'll only add complexity when it's needed and avoid it altogether when I can.
* Book vibe: I wanted to make a website that felt like it was wrapped in a [dust jacket][duck jacket]. Maybe a dust jacket is the wrong model to use, but the writing + short bio layout that forms the core of weblog layouts seems to share many of its reasons for existing with dust jackets of printed, hardcover books. Also, dust jackets only appear on hardcover books, and hardcover books have this sentimental weight unlike other things. (Book vibe _does not_ means I'll be doing anything cheesy like titling my Archive page "Table of Contents", &c.)
* Keep it simple: using 5 colors (#0C306D, #6F83A5, #FCFDFF, #C5DAFD, #1B6BEF) and 4 typefaces (PT Serif, regular and italic; Chivo, regular and italic).
* Version control: I'm publishing my work on this website to [its own repo][gh repo]. It has the hard-candy center of this site, incase anybody else wants to get up and running using my setup. I'm also letting my posts get uploaded to GitHub too, at least for now. It's an idea I've wanted to try out for a while.
