From [_Internet.org Is Not Neutral, Not Secure, and Not the Internet_](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/internetorg-not-neutral-not-secure-and-not-internet), by Jeremy Gillula and Jeremy Malcolm:

> While we applaud Facebook's efforts to encourage more websites to provide support for low-end feature phones by stripping out “heavy” content, we would like to see Internet.org try harder to achieve its very worthy objective of connecting the remaining two thirds of the world to the Internet. We have confidence that it would be possible to provide a limited free Internet access service that is secure, and that doesn't rely on Facebook and its partners to maintain a central list of approved sites. Until then, Internet.org will not be living up to its promise, or its name.

There's a profitable motivation for Facebook by building Internet access.
The zero-rated web pages are a really powerful magnifier.

Now, that doesn't mean it's the driving motivation.
I'm sure the people working on this are really nice and considerate people.
These folk are working on solving a really difficult, expensive problem.
And focusing on a document-driven web is a great cause.
Undue concern should be paid to unfamiliar constraints like limited data and connectivity.

But there's not even an acknowledgement of the compromise of neutrality.
Like Gillula and Malcom say, delivering a neutral Internet with this technology is possible.
And Facebook is doing things with this project that stretch the technologically possible.
_Solar powered drones_ and _shooting the Internet with lasers_ sounds impossible.
Facebook chose to build walls.
Facebook made choices because it's a grown-up.
This is not an easy job, it's not just waiting for somebody else to do it.

By naming the project _Internet.org_ and not _Facebook.com_, there's no acknowledgement of that choice.
It hides its reality behind world changing dreams.
It's already something I can imagine producing a waja TED talk.
But by making the compromises that it did, it failed to meet expectations.
If its not the Internet, don't pretend its the Internet.
Don't call it the Internet.
