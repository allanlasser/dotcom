This cover story in _Bloomberg Businessweek_ is good, as usual.
It's about [Germany's ambitious and underwhelming airport in Berlin][businessweek].
I encourage you to go and read it yourself.

But what really struck me were the photos.
The photographer for the piece was the Berlin-based [Ã‰river Hijano](http://eriverhijano.com/).
I'm going to start paying closer attention to their work.
