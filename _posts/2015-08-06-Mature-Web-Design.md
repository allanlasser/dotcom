I've pushed a bunch of user interface upgrades to [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/) in the past few weeks.
The typography follows a three/fourths scale.
The colors are more tightly coordinated.
The navigation is simpler and more consistent.
Layouts follow specific patterns.
I like to think of it as a maturation of the visual language.
It actually looks very good, but don't just take my word for it.

The previous CSS was a tangle of single-case rules because I made the rules up as I went.
Some declarations weren't even being used.
Now, there's basic rules and considered exceptions.
This results in a visual language that's cleaner and more consistent.
It also reduced the complexity of my CSS.
This means reduced file size and reduced loading times.

[Good design is as little design as possible.](http://theindustry.cc/2015/07/13/good-design-is-as-little-design-as-possible/)
This is especially true in web design.
