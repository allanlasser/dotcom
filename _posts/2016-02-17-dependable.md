[Craig Mod](http://craigmod.com/sputnik/leica_q/):

> A product has to earn its place in the world. Especially a product that’s being commoditized and attacked from all sides. It has to function not only at absolute peak performance (in this case, infallibly take great photos), but it has to do so while simultaneously delighting us. I’m a stickler for that: the delight.

> The contemporary camera market is such that lots of kits operate at this so-called point of peak performance. But are they fun? Joyful to use? Are they light enough to carry with you all day without feeling burdened, but heavy enough to feel substantial, to take a beating? To depend on?

Yes! This! I want dependable tools. I want tools that materialize when I need them and disappear the rest of the time. And when in use, I want these tools to respond with joy and grace. Craig talks about how he learned to see through the camera, and learned from the camera itself—I want my tools to teach me how to use them better.

Also: I want to read more reviews like Craig's. I want to learn about a tool as it is lived with. So much of the technology reviews I read are focused on "will you be made happy by buying this thing?" rather than "was I made happy by using this thing?". Granted, that's a much harder question to answer and it's unfair to expect all writers to be able to afford the time to answer these questions.

It's clear, however, that this review was produced out of a love for this tool. It's clear in the effort he went to compose it, to present it, and to be honest about it. We need more dependable tools, and we need more people who recognize their value.
