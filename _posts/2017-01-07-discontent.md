I'm so peeved whenever I hear someone say "content".
We _already_ have a problem when we've poured hours of work, care, and attention into something that's going to be inserted, undifferentiated, into a feed that most people will scroll right by. We _already_ have a problem when we're unable to convince others of the value of this work, or the value of our efforts overall. We _already_ have a problem of too much garbage and too little thought out in the world. We don't need to make the problem worse by dismissing this work as an identical piece of pluggable "content".

It's this dismissive way of thinking, considering, and valuing any piece of hard work that really gets to me. If we can't find a way to think about and hold up our work when we talk to one another (within media!), how are we ever going to convince anybody else that what we're doing is worth their attention? 
Come on and let's try to find a more respectful and attentive word than "content".
