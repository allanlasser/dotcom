The other day I was hanging out with friends.
We had just finished a round of Mario Kart.
Everybody started chatting and left the game on the results screen.
The music that backed the results screen kept looping, though.
It sounded like some strange gameshow or elevator music.
It sounded really cool.

So I started looking around for other endlessly repeatable videogame tunes.
I learned that a ton of peeps have already had this idea.
You can find video game music that's been extended.
For example:

I can remember a significant number of the videogame tunes, from when I got my first console [^1] and on.
Videogame songs are probably as memorable for me as TV theme songs are for my parents.
And if videogame music is as similar to muzak as I'm suspecting they are, then that's really interesting.
