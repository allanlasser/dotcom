title: Frames, not rectangles

Computers are not [glowing rectangles][brichter].

When we think otherwise, we forget that computers are reprogrammable.
Computers are intended to be flexible.
They are engineered to allow for maximum flexibility.
Another phrase for a poorly-conceived computer architecture is a "brittle" architecture.

Frank Chimero (of course), in his essay [_What Screens Want_][chimero], articulates this idea better than I can.
He writes, "increasingly, technology feels like something that happens to you instead of something you use."
That’s exactly the conflict that images like glowing rectangles are built upon.
It is a conflict between seeing computers as tools beyond your control versus seeing computers as these beautiful machines that abstract their own complexity just enough so that ordinary people can begin to use them.

Software imitates all the other machines we used to use for writing, reading, learning, listening, and talking.
And we can run that software on machines that fit in our pockets, and that we can take anywhere.
These machines should be seen as incredible liberators, of opening doors where none existed before.
Maybe I'm just a huge nerd, but I see these machines as liberating, not overpowering.

The hardest part about writing computer programs is building them to be flexible.
The most tedious part of writing programs is ferreting out the edge cases.
When something does fall through the cracks, the program breaks—it has a bug.
You can never think of them all.
There's always another bug.

Remember "brittle" architectures?
Rigorous logic sounds impressive, but it's terrible for programs.
Programs have to accomodate all different kinds of inputs.
They have to allow for all different kinds of users.
Software has to be fluid, plastic.
Software has to be accessible, egalitarian.
Otherwise it's a lousy piece of software.

Last week I tried to answer ["What is a website?"][what is a website] in as many ways as I could.
I think I've gotten all those answers down to one:
a website is a frame.
Websites, like the computer programs that serve and render them, are flexible and elastic.
They can't make any assumptions about the "true" state of the site.
They can't enforce any rules on how the site will be seen or used or reused.
They can only accomodate.
They can only draw the boundaries on what it is, provide some limits towards what it could be.
It's a sea of uncertainty, it's my job to eliminate as much uncertainty as possible.
But there will always be unknowns that creep up.
There will always be bugs crawling around inside our machines.
But the face that problems can emerge?
That the unknown can suddenly reveal itself from within the confines of the program, of the machine?
That's a feature, not a bug.

We are given these tools with all this power and potential and we can carry them around and point them at things and use them to achieve all sorts of amazing work that’d be too time consuming or expensive to do before. These aren’t rectangles, they aren’t the last mile of the culture supply chain. They’re frames, and they want to show us things we couldn’t see or hear or feel before. And to think otherwise, to perceive these machines with skepticism and hostility and cynicism: that just about breaks my heart.
