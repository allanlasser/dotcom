I've been working with the [React framework](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) recently.
It's pretty cool.
It's gotten me to really focus back on the basics: arranging elements into components.
Buttons, toggles, switches all pin the interface into place.
Design is in the details: a platitude worth repeating.

[It's in that spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams#Dieter_Rams:_ten_principles_for_good_design) that I flipped through the web looking for Dieter Rams's electronics.
Courtesy <http://dieterrams.tumblr.com>, here's some stand out examples:

![Radio 2]({{ site.images }}/dieter_rams/radio2.jpg "A radio photographed from an angle")

![Radio 3]({{ site.images }}/dieter_rams/radio3.jpg "A closeup on the same radio model as the last image, with a focus on the layout of the buttons, tuner, and spectrum interface")

What I like about these is how interactive elements are highlighted.
It only draws your attention to things it you should know about.

![Radio 1]({{ site.images }}/dieter_rams/radio.jpg "A boxy, silver radio with many buttons")

![Turntable]({{ site.images }}/dieter_rams/turntable.jpg "A modern turntable with clean lines and a blinding white finish")

I like the arrangements of these.

One weird thing I am only just noticing after putting all these images adjacent is that they're all sound equipment.
