While looking for something else, I came across the [Texas Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Towers), a set of radar platforms built in the late 50s.
The radar were intended to detect squads of Soviet bomber planes.
The radar were put on top of basically oil derricks.
This supposed to extend their range.

The first tower to be built, [Texas Tower 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Tower_2), stood off of Cape Cod.
I know, it's confusing, right?
If Texas Tower 2 was the first one built, what happened to TT1?
The U.S. [Air Defense Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_Defense_Command) had planned for five towers to be built.
But budget constraints forced them to cut two towers from the budget.

It's a good thing we didn't build too many.
The development of the ICBM made these radar stations obsolete.
(Missiles _disrupted_ the market for dropping bombs from planes, you could say.)
So they were all torn down just a few years after being built.
