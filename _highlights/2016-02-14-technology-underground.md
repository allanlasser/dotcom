> For a long time I’d been chasing the Cloud believing I just needed better maps and better data—on the data centers, the fiber routes. After spending time with the people who follow, revise, and fundamentally distrust the maps, I’m less and less sure that having one is even the point. Even if by some act of divine providence all the telecoms opened all their data on all their dark fiber and data centers, I’d want—and frankly, the world would still need—utility locators and cable markings. Seeing systems at a distance may allow patterns to emerge, but it also affords them a coherence, infallibility, and control that they might never really have.
