> It’s a crisp fall afternoon in October and Matt Stopera, a 28-year-old BuzzFeed senior editor, is discussing hoverboards — "a good, funny recent example of something where we were a little too soon," he tells me. "A couple of weeks ago, we did a post on people failing. They’re falling." When I tell Stopera that I saw the piece everywhere on Twitter, he’s dismissive. "In our Twitter world," meaning media and tech professionals, "everyone was talking about it, but in the real world, people aren’t really talking about it."

> Collecting massive amounts of data over time has allowed BuzzFeed to learn, among other things, that while ideas get an early start on Twitter, they go wide and become popular on Facebook (which is what Stopera understood about hoverboards).

> No one—not Peretti, Nguyen, or anyone else—actually has an exact idea how many pieces of content BuzzFeed creates or where it all gets published. Today, internal teams monitor their output using Google Spreadsheets and Slack—a hack that fails to match BuzzFeed’s increasingly complicated distribution system.
